# PermaNet Implementation Playbook

## Introduction
This playbook provides detailed, step-by-step guidance to fully implement and operationalize the PermaNet decentralized registrar.

## Setup Environment
- Node.js & npm installation
- Solidity Compiler & Hardhat Setup
- Wallet integration (Metamask, RainbowKit)

## Deploy Smart Contracts
1. Compile contracts using Hardhat.
2. Deploy to Polygon Supernet.
3. Verify deployment on-chain using Etherscan or PolygonScan.

## Configure IOTA for Resolution
1. Install @iota/client Node.js package.
2. Connect to IOTA Chrysalis nodes for domain resolution.
3. Integrate resolver service with your DApp.

## Arweave Permanent Storage
1. Install Arweave Node.js package.
2. Implement metadata storage scripts.
3. Upload domain-related metadata permanently to Arweave.

## Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
1. Setup IOTA Identity or ICP.
2. Generate Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).
3. Link these DIDs to domain ownership verification.

## Frontend Integration
1. Setup Next.js React DApp.
2. Connect frontend to smart contracts and APIs.
3. Ensure wallet connectivity for users.

## DAO Governance
1. Define governance rules and structures.
2. Implement voting mechanisms in smart contracts.
3. Provide DAO management interface within DApp.

## Maintenance & Scaling
- Regularly audit and update smart contracts.
- Optimize IOTA and Arweave integrations.
- Engage community through continuous governance improvements.

## Security & Compliance
- Conduct regular security audits.
- Implement bug bounty programs.
- Ensure compliance with global data and identity protection standards.
