# Frontend Merge Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps needed to merge the TypeScript-based frontend with the React Frontend folder to create a unified frontend with all NFT marketplace functionality.

## Component Migration Strategy

### 1. Model-Related Components
- Merge `frontend/components/ModelCard.tsx` with `React Frontend/components/ModelCard.js`
  - Keep TypeScript interfaces and types
  - Incorporate additional UI elements from React Frontend version
  - Maintain Chakra UI styling system

### 2. Pages Structure
- Combine pages from both frontends:
  - Merge `frontend/pages/ai-models/index.tsx` with `React Frontend/pages/AIModelsPage.js`
  - Keep TypeScript structure and add features from React version

### 3. Web3 Integration
- Use TypeScript version (`frontend/utils/web3.ts`) as base
- Incorporate additional functions from `React Frontend/utils/web3.js`
- Maintain type safety with TypeScript interfaces

### 4. Component Features to Preserve
- Category filtering
- Search functionality
- Model execution
- NFT marketplace interactions
- Wallet connection handling

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**
   - Create new frontend directory with TypeScript + React setup
   - Configure Chakra UI and other required dependencies

2. **Component Migration**
   - Move TypeScript components first
   - Convert JavaScript components to TypeScript
   - Merge duplicate functionality

3. **Testing**
   - Ensure all NFT marketplace features work
   - Verify wallet connections
   - Test model execution
   - Validate search and filtering

4. **Cleanup**
   - Remove old frontend folders
   - Update documentation
   - Update build scripts

## Notes
- Maintain TypeScript for better type safety
- Keep Chakra UI as the styling system
- Preserve all existing functionality from both frontends
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing smart contracts
