# Frontend Cleanup Instructions

The frontend merge has been completed successfully with all functionality now unified in the `unified-frontend` directory. To complete the cleanup, please manually remove the following directories:

1. Remove `JoyNet/frontend` directory
2. Remove `JoyNet/React Frontend` directory

These directories have been fully merged into the new unified TypeScript frontend implementation.

## Verification Steps

1. Ensure all files from both old frontends are present in the unified frontend:
   - Model-related components ✓
   - Web3 integration ✓
   - NFT marketplace features ✓
   - User profile and staking ✓
   - Search and filtering ✓

2. Verify functionality:
   - Wallet connection works
   - Model listing and viewing works
   - Buying and executing models works
   - Staking interface works
   - User profile works

3. Update any documentation or configuration files that reference the old frontend paths to point to the new unified frontend.

## Note
Do not delete these directories if you still need to:
- Migrate any remaining configuration
- Transfer any environment variables
- Copy additional assets

Once you have verified everything is working in the unified frontend, you can safely remove the old frontend directories.
