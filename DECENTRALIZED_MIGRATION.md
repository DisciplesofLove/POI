# Decentralized Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove AWS dependencies and ensure the repository is ready for decentralized deployment only.

## Files Removed

1. **buildspec.yml** - Removed AWS CodeBuild configuration file

## Files Modified

1. **DEVELOPMENT.md**
   - Removed AWS deployment section
   - Added detailed decentralized deployment instructions

2. **README.md**
   - Updated setup instructions to focus on decentralized deployment
   - Added reference to detailed decentralized deployment guide
   - Updated production readiness section to emphasize decentralized nature

3. **src/test_secrets_manager.py**
   - Removed boto3 dependency
   - Updated tests to use the decentralized CryptoVault instead of AWS Secrets Manager

## Files Added

1. **Dockerfile**
   - Created multi-stage build for decentralized deployment
   - Includes IPFS and P2P network setup

2. **deployment/docker-compose.yml**
   - Added configuration for running decentralized nodes
   - Includes IPFS, Prometheus, and Grafana services

3. **deployment/DECENTRALIZED_DEPLOYMENT.md**
   - Comprehensive guide for decentralized deployment
   - Instructions for single node, multi-node, and validator node setup

4. **deployment/entrypoint.sh**
   - Script to initialize IPFS and P2P network in Docker container

5. **config/prometheus.yml**
   - Configuration for decentralized monitoring with Prometheus

6. **config/alert_rules.yml**
   - Alert rules for decentralized monitoring

## Architecture Changes

1. **Secrets Management**
   - Moved from AWS Secrets Manager to decentralized CryptoVault
   - Uses IPFS for storage and IOTA for verification

2. **Deployment**
   - Removed AWS-specific deployment
   - Added Docker-based decentralized deployment
   - Added P2P network bootstrapping

3. **Monitoring**
   - Moved from centralized monitoring to decentralized Prometheus/Grafana setup
   - Added local alerting without centralized dependencies

## Testing

All tests have been updated to work with the decentralized architecture, removing any AWS dependencies.

## Next Steps

1. **Further Decentralization**
   - Consider implementing a fully decentralized CI/CD pipeline
   - Explore additional decentralized storage options beyond IPFS

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement additional security measures for the decentralized deployment
   - Add secure key management for validator nodes

3. **Documentation**
   - Create additional documentation for specific decentralized use cases
   - Add troubleshooting guides for common decentralized deployment issues
