# Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Implementation Analysis
The current implementation shows several areas where we can optimize for the sub-100ms latency target:

1. Model loading is synchronous and blocking
2. No pre-emptive model loading
3. Basic GPU utilization without hardware acceleration
4. Sequential inference execution without batching

## Proposed Optimizations

### 1. Pre-emptive Model Loading
- Implement predictive model loading based on user patterns
- Maintain hot model cache with most frequently used models
- Use GPU memory more efficiently with model sharing

### 2. Hardware Acceleration
- Integrate FPGA acceleration for ZK proofs
- Optimize GPU memory management
- Implement tensor operation fusion

### 3. Latency Optimization
- Add geospatial node selection
- Implement model sharding across GPUs
- Add batching for concurrent requests

### 4. Community Features
- Implement free tier with IOTA-based validation
- Add community contribution tracking
- Integrate with social platforms for verification

## Implementation Tasks
1. Update InferenceNode class with GPU memory management
2. Modify EdgeNode to support model prediction
3. Add FPGA acceleration support
4. Implement geospatial routing

This will be implemented incrementally through code updates.
