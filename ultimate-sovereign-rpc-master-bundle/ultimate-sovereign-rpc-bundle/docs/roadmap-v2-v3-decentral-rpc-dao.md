# 🚀 Decentralized RPC DAO - Roadmap (v2 / v3)

## 🌐 Vision
Create a **fully decentralized, community-governed RPC fleet** that operates autonomously, self-heals, proves data integrity with zero-knowledge proofs, and evolves via on-chain governance.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 (Current State - v1)

### What’s Already Built
✔️ Multi-chain fleet manager (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Cosmos, Solana)  
✔️ Automated deployment (Ansible + Docker Compose)  
✔️ Full observability (Prometheus + Grafana)  
✔️ Auto-healing mesh sync layer (peer-to-peer data repair)  
✔️ Reverse proxy with Caddy (secure RPC gateway)  
✔️ Security hardening (UFW, Fail2Ban, WireGuard)

---

## 🔗 Phase 2 - Governance and Reputation Layer (v2)

### Goals
✅ Introduce **decentralized governance** for fleet upgrades and policies.  
✅ Create **reputation scoring** for each node (uptime, latency, response accuracy).  
✅ Enable **on-chain incentives** (pay-per-request, staking for uptime, slashing for misconduct).

### Proposed Components
| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Governance | Snapshot / Cosmos SDK / Aragon |
| Reputation | IPFS reputation DAG + Prometheus data feed |
| Incentives | Smart contract for rewards & slashing |
| Payments | Native token + on-chain payment gateway |

---

## 🔐 Phase 3 - zkRPC and Full Proof-of-Data (v3)

### Goals
✅ Every response must include **a cryptographic proof** that data came from the canonical blockchain state.  
✅ Add support for **zk-SNARK or zk-STARK proofs** at the RPC response level.  
✅ Enable users to **verify responses locally** — full trustlessness.

### Proposed Components
| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Proof Generation | zk-SNARK circuits (gnark/halo2) |
| Proof Storage | IPFS + Arweave (proof persistence) |
| Proof Validation | Light clients + client-side proof checks |
| RPC Extensions | Add `proof` field to each response |

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 - Decentralized Observability Network

### Goals
✅ Fully decentralized metrics collection (no Prometheus master).  
✅ All nodes push anonymized telemetry to **distributed observability mesh**.  
✅ Fleet-wide dashboards live in **IPFS-hosted Grafana**.

### Proposed Components
| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Metrics Transport | GossipSub / NATS Mesh |
| Dashboard Hosting | IPFS-hosted Grafana |
| Peer Discovery | LibP2P node announcements |
| Reputation Feed | Metrics feed directly into reputation DAG |

---

## 🧩 Phase 5 - Modular Chain Expansion

### Goals
✅ Support every major chain (Bitcoin, Avalanche, Base, Near, zkSync, Celestia, Cosmos Zones).  
✅ New chains added via **governance vote + open module spec**.  
✅ Each module includes:
- Docker Compose definition
- Snapshot/Sync script
- Proof generation circuit (if supported)

---

## 📜 Summary Timeline

| Phase | Milestone | ETA |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | Core Fleet Manager + Mesh Sync | ✅ Ready |
| v2 | Governance + Reputation | Q2 2025 |
| v3 | zkRPC + Data Provenance | Q3 2025 |
| v4 | Decentral Observability Mesh | Q4 2025 |
| v5 | Modular Chain Expansion | Continuous |

---

## 💥 End Goal - Sovereign RPC DAO

The fleet becomes a fully **autonomous public good**, governed by its operators and users, provably honest, financially sustainable, and resilient against all forms of censorship.
