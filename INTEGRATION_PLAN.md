   - Ensure consistent styling

2. Smart Contract Integration:
   - Deploy PermaNetDomainRegistry contract
   - Add contract interactions to frontend
   - Implement domain management UI

3. RPC Configuration:
   - Set up docker-compose configuration
   - Configure multi-chain support
   - Implement secure RPC endpoints

4. Testing and Deployment:
   - Test integrated components
   - Verify contract interactions
   - Deploy unified system
