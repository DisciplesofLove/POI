# Polygon Supernet and IOTA Integration

## Required Changes

1. Network Migration
- Move contracts from Ethereum to Polygon Supernet
- Update contract deployment configurations
- Implement bridging mechanisms if needed

2. IOTA Integration for Feeless Inference
- Implement IOTA Identity for authentication
- Use IOTA streams for data transfer
- Enable feeless inference using IOTA's network

3. Decentralized Control
- Remove any centralized control mechanisms
- Implement DAO governance
- Ensure model control is fully decentralized

## Implementation Steps

1. Update hardhat.config.js to include Polygon Supernet network configuration
2. Modify ModelMarketplace.sol to support IOTA integration
3. Update inference_node.py to use IOTA Streams
4. Implement DAO governance for model control
5. Remove centralized admin controls from smart contracts
