# Community DNS Integration

The PermaNet marketplace ecosystem has been enhanced to support community ownership of internet domains through the following components:

1. **PermaNetDomainRegistry**: Manages the core domain registration system including TLDs and subdomains
2. **PermaNetDAORegistry**: Enables community governance of TLDs through DAOs
3. **ModelMarketplaceV2**: Handles the marketplace functionality including model registration and usage
4. **PermaNetMarketplaceAdapter**: Bridges domains, DAOs, and marketplace functionality

## How It Works

1. Top-Level Domains (TLDs) can be owned by:
   - Individual owners
   - DAO communities (through PermaNetDAORegistry)

2. When a TLD is controlled by a DAO:
   - Community members can stake tokens to participate in governance
   - Domain registrations must be approved through DAO voting
   - The community can set policies and manage the TLD collectively

3. Models in the marketplace can be:
   - Associated with domains
   - Updated and managed by their owners
   - Integrated with the IOTA network for secure data streaming

## Community Benefits

- Decentralized governance of internet namespaces
- Democratic decision-making for domain registrations
- Integration of AI models with permanent web infrastructure
- Community-driven policies and standards

## Technical Integration

The PermaNetMarketplaceAdapter acts as the bridge between these systems:
- Verifies domain availability and ownership
- Checks DAO governance requirements for domain registration
- Links marketplace models with permanent domains
- Ensures proper access control and permissions

This integration enables a truly community-owned internet where domain governance is decentralized and democratic.
